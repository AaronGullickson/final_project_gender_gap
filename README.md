# The Gender Wage Gap and Occupational Sorting

It is well known that women have significantly lower wages than men. One important possible explanation for this difference is that men and women are sorted (via the educational and training system, discriminatory practices, and socialized preferences) into different types of occupations and that “feminized” occupations (e.g. nurses, administative support, teachers) tend to pay less than occupations that are dominated by men. For this project , I want you to answer two research questions:

1. How much of the gender wage gap can be accounted for by this occupational sorting?
2. How does the gender wage gap vary across different types of occupations? 

For both questions, I want you to also account for the control variables of age, nativity, highest degree received, and number of own children in the household.

For this topic we will use data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) to compare the hourly wages of men and women in the US workforce. The data were collected in March of 2017. The data are provided as a an RData file in the input directory of this repository. The input directory also includes a PDF file with more information about the dataset and the variables that i contains.

## Performing the analysis and producing the report

You can use either a separate script or an R Markdown file to perform your analysis, but the ultimate report should be written up using an R Markdown file. This R Markdown file should be knitted to a PDF file which you will upload to the Canvas site. You should also be sure to commit and push your final code and results back to GitHub. I will be evaluating both your written work and the analysis itself.

The report will typically be around 5-7 pages including figures and tables. The report should have the following format:

- **Introduction**: state the research question (in your own words). This is also a good place to indicate why this is an interesting research question. Use your sociological imagination here. 
- **Data and methods**: describe the data (where it came from, how variables were constructed, how big the sample is, etc.). You may use the report provided on each dataset to help craft this description, but **you must describe it in your own words**. You should include graphical presentations of the distribution of the dependent variable and the critical independent variable(s). 
- **Results**: Report what you found. Typically, this will involve a figure or multiple figures showing the key relationship (e.g. scatterplot, comparative boxplots, etc) and a table of regression model results. Be sure to interpret your results in straightforward concrete terms. Your results table(s) should include measures of statistical significance such as the standard error and an asterisks if the p-value was less than 0.05. Round all values in the table(s) to three decimal places. 
- **Conclusions**: Summarize the findings and discuss any weaknesses or ideas for future research.

All tables and figures should be well captioned and self-explanatory. I should be able to understand what the table or figure is reporting without reading the report itself.

# The Gender Wage Gap and Occupational Sorting

It is well known that women have significantly lower wages than men. One important possible explanation for this difference is that men and women are sorted (via the educational and training system, discriminatory practices, and socialized preferences) into different types of occupations and that “feminized” occupations (e.g. nurses, administative support, teachers) tend to pay less than occupations that are dominated by men. For this project , I want you to answer two research questions:

1. How much of the gender wage gap can be accounted for by this occupational sorting?
2. How does the gender wage gap vary across different types of occupations? 

For both questions, I want you to also account for the control variables of age, nativity, highest degree received, and number of own children in the household.

For this topic we will use data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) to compare the hourly wages of men and women in the US workforce. The data were collected in March of 2017. The data are provided as a an RData file in the input directory of this repository. The input directory also includes a PDF file with more information about the dataset and the variables that i contains.
